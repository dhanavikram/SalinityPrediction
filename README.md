# Prediction of Water Salinity Levels

Salinity plays a key role in analyzing the water cycle, ocean circulation, and climate change, as it driving ocean currents and circulation patterns. Variations in salinity affect the density of seawater, which in turn influences its movement and mixing. Many marine organisms have adapted to specific salinity levels, so variations in salinity can directly impact their distribution, reproduction, and survival.

CTD stands for conductivity, temperature, and depth, and refers to a package of electronic instruments that measure oceanographic properties (i.e., the physical features of seawater such as salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a, nutrients, and many more). A CTD cast gives scientists a precise and comprehensive charting of the distribution and variation of water oceanographic properties that helps to understand how the oceans affect life. `CalCOFI.csv` contains a subset of data from the CalCOFI dataset that represents the longest (1949-present) and most complete (more than 50,000 sampling stations) time series of oceanographic and larval fish data captured in the world. This database contains oceanographic data measured using CTD casts from seawater samples collected at CalCOFI stations.

In this notebook, the goal is to design a machine learning model that estimates water salinity based on biochemical oceanographic measurements and measurement year. Data contains 325,281 measurements sampled between 1980-2016.
